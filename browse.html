        <h5>Find your new or used Porsche at your Authorized Porsche Dealer</h5>
        <p>
          Porsche Finder is the official search platform to find a new or used
          car of our authorized Porsche. You can browse current car offers and
          view the latest inventory available from your local Porsche Dealer.
          You can search by any model whether it is the timeless 911 or the
          electrified Taycan. You can refine your search by optional equipment,
          color, and price.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find your ideal Porsche whether you are interested in new or
          used Porsche cars. And for extra confidence in finding the perfect
          used car, search for Certified Pre-Owned Porsche (Porsche Approved),
          which gets the Porsche approval by going through a rigorous 111-point
          inspection and comes with 24 months car warranty (US Only) and
          Roadside Assistance, providing you greater confidence and guaranteed
          quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also find other convenient tools such as trade-in estimators,
          financial calculations, apply for credit or reserve your next Porsche
          through the platform.
        </p>
        <p>We look forward to helping you find your next Porsche!</p>
        <h5>From the 718 Boxster and Cayman, to the 911 and Cayenne</h5>
        <p>
          In Porsche Finder, you can find everything from our current cars, such
          as the Taycan Turbo S to a Porsche Classic 356, and anything in
          between. The filter options give you a choice to refine your search
          between Porsche new cars, used cars, and Certified Pre-Owned (Porsche
          Approved) used cars, and so much more!
        </p>
